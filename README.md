# Using Remote Sensed Data for Social &amp; Economic Decision Making in Zimbabwe

## About the repo:
This is the 2022 DSPG Zimbabwe Project #2022_DSPG_Zimbabwe. This code repository contains R-scripts, shapefiles, images, and data that are used as a framework for building our ShinyApp project.
We use the Google Earth Engine using the Python API to get weather data. These codes are currently in use for the 'Data Science for Public Good' program taught at Virginia Tech in the summer of 2022 and are available for use. Users are encouraged to work with their local environment, but the Google Earth Engine data are run on Google Colab (other prefered python based platform).

### Google Earth Data
To view the code we used to download our weather indices please visit: [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/163e-gYd_1DbGElMiTHTJrTtlnetVu11T?usp=sharing#scrollTo=MzNgO88VTWWQ).
The downloaded and processed data can be located in our data folder within our ShinyApp folder.


### PICES Data
We use the data from the [2021 Zimbabwe project](https://dspgtools.shinyapps.io/dspg21zimbabwe/). Here is the link to their repo: [link](https://github.com/yangcheng258/2021_DSPG_Zimbabwe). The specific data we use can also be located in our data within our ShinyApp folder.


## Images
The images we used and generated are in the www folder within our ShinyApp folder.


## Shiny App
To view the code we used to render our our Shiny App please visit the app.R file.
