Can Remotely Sensed Data be Used for Social & Economic Decision Making?

## Overview:
This repository contains R-scripts, shapefiles, images, and data that are used as a framework for building our ShinyApp project. The main file of interest is rain.Rmd. All other files we used for practice and should be treated as such. We have gone through different versions of input data so the code doesn't all look the same.


##### Ag_region.Rmd 
This file processed the data into daily data, no visualizations were generated here.This is a preliminary file to find the dry spells

##### app.R
This file is used to get a draft of the shiny app for precipitation. 

##### Dry_Days_By_Regio.Rmd 
This file is a preliminary file to find the dry spells. Some visualizations were generated here.

##### Dryspell.Rmd
This file has no code within it. Please disregard it.

##### Leaflet_Precipitation.Rmd 
This file has a basic leaflet that was used to experiment with leaflet. However, the code isn't useful 

##### Mapping_Precip.Rmd 
This is file could be another file of interest. We generate a lot of different maps here. Along with the use of a unique package for the dryspells. 

##### MPI_2011.Rmd
This file was used as an exercise with the MPI. However, since the MPI was given to us there wasn't a need for this in the long run.

##### PRECIP_further_processing.Rmd
This file was used to make a line graph but I never got around to finishing it. Please disregard it.

##### PrecipitationData&Visualizations.Rmd
This file is a great example to visualize the data. However, since efficiency was never a concern of mine in the beginning. One will notice repetitive code but it's still serves as an example.

##### rain.Rmd
This is the main file of interest. Processes data and generates visual using functions. 

##### rain2.Rmd
This is an earlier version of rain.Rmd

##### tester_leaflet.R
This file served as an practice to implement an interactive map in the shiny app. Later on, this was disregard as leaflets would take too long to load upon launch and cause the app to disconnect. 

##### TransposeData.Rmd 
This file was just another iteration of practice. It processes data and generates so line graphs.
